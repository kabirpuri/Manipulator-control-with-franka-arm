# Manipulator Control with 7 DOF Franka Arm  

## Overview  
This project focuses on developing a **robot control library** for the **7-DOF Franka Emika Panda arm**, integrating **forward and inverse kinematics** with a vision system. Additionally, advanced **path planning algorithms** such as **RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Trees)** and **Potential Fields** were implemented for efficient motion planning in dynamic environments.  

## Features  
- **Forward & Inverse Kinematics:** Computes precise joint configurations for desired end-effector positions.  
- **Integrated Vision System:** Enables object recognition and interaction using computer vision.  
- **Path Planning Algorithms:**  
  - **RRT:** Efficient motion planning for navigating complex environments.  
  - **Potential Fields:** Real-time obstacle avoidance for smooth motion.  
- **Optimized Manipulation Strategies:** Enhances interaction with static and dynamic objects.
